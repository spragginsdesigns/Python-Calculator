**Version**: 1.0  

## Purpose
The Terminal Python Calculator is a straightforward and interactive tool designed to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's user-friendly, ensuring ease of use for anyone familiar with basic terminal commands.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.
- **Interactive User Input**: Choose operations and input numbers interactively.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures only numeric inputs are accepted.
- **Division by Zero Handling**: Gracefully handles division by zero with an error message.

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisite**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. **Get the Script**: Download or clone the repository containing `calculator.py`.
3. **Run the Script**:
   ```shell
   python calculator.py
   ```
4. **Follow Prompts**: Choose an operation and input numbers as prompted.

## Operations

- `Add`: Sum two numbers.
- `Subtract`: Subtract the second number from the first.
- `Multiply`: Multiply two numbers together.
- `Divide`: Divide the first number by the second (includes division by zero handling).

## Exiting the Program
